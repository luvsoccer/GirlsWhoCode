<h3>Soccer is a main part of my life. I have soccer practices 3 days a week and have games on 2 days.My dream is to become a famous soccer player. </h3>
<h2><u>Art</u></h2>
<h3>As much as I love soccer, I love art as well. My best painting is one where the moon is shining in a forest and the lake in front of it. <br>I spent about 2 hours on that painting and I hope to make more like it.<br></h3>
