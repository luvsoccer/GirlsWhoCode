<h3> Before starting, here is a link to a website that I have created as an example to what we will be doing: <br> http://luvsoccer.github.io/GirlsWhoCode/index.html </h3>
<h3> You can copy the url and paste it on a different tab. </h3>

<h2>Starting the code</h2>
<h3> To start, the first tag is < !DOCTYPE html > It is one of the only tags that do not have an end tag.</h3>
<h3> Next you put the < html > tag. Do not forget the end tag which is the same as the beginning except with a back slash in front of it</h3>
<h3> Then, you put the < head > tag. Always put an end tag except if said not to! </h3>
<h3> Finally put a < body > tag.</h3>

<h2> This is how it should look: </h2>
<br>
<h3> < !DOCTYPE html > </h3>
<h3> < html > </h3>
<h3> < head > </h3>
<br>
<h3> < title> Text < title> </h3>
<br>
<h3> < /head > </h3>
<br>
<h3> < body > </h3>
<br>
<h3> < /body > </h3>
<h3> < /html > </h3>
