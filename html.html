<h3> Every single website that I've looked at has text. That is why HTML is important. <br> Let's start with the basics.</h3>
<h3> There are many sizes in text, h1, h2, and h3, h4, and so on.</h3>
<h1> This is h1</h1>
<h2> This is h2</h2>
<h3> This is h3</h3>
<h4> This is h4</h4>
<h5> This is h5</h5>
<h3> You can choose the size that is appropriate for what you are writing.</h3>
