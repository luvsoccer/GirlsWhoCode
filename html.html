<h3> Every single website that I've looked at has text. That is why HTML is important. <br> Let's start with the basics.</h3>
<h3> There are 3 basic sizes in text, h1, h2, and h3.</h3>
<h1> This is h1</h1>
<h2> This is h2</h2>
<h3> This is h3</h3>
<h3> You can choose the size that is appropriate for what you are writing.</h3>
<h3> You can apply text by typing < h3 >. Then an end tag will pop-up. You type in between the 2 tags like this. The end tag will have a back slash before the command.< /h3 ></h3>
